The Word of Egg is the center of being a follower. The book is a mandatory read for all followers of the church, and all incoming immigrants are issued a copy for mandatory reading. The book is sold commercially in the United States, and with that, Amazon and Books-a-Million are fantastic places to find the book.
</p>
<p>
Because we care about our followers, all purchases of the book include the following:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>The Word of Egg</li>
  <li>Photo of Gregg McEgg</li>
   <li>Reference Sheet for Immigration to Eggtopia</li>
</ol>
<p>
All of this can be purchased for $59.99!
</p>
<p>
Purchasing the Word of Egg means a lot to Eggtopia. If you are reading the Word of Egg and you have not yet immigrated to Eggtopia, we highly recommend that you do so.
