<h2>
Chicken Week Overview
</h2>
<img src="chicken.png" alt="The Only Thing to Hate" title=><br/>The Only Thing to Hate</>
<p>
As stated on our homepage, chickens are the true enemy of Eggtopia as they are constantly trying to steal our beloved eggs (which we know come solely from dinosaurs). With that, we hold Chicken Week, an annual period of seven days devoted to the cleansing of chickens.
</p>
<p>
Chickens are stupid, and with that, we are always able to lure them to Eggtopia with our very own Chicken Bait™. The chickens can smell it from extreme distances and they are able to fly to Eggtopia using their wings. By that point, our citizens are prepared and awaiting these chickens, and from there on, their sole goal is to cleanse as many chickens as they possibly can. This lasts until the loudspeakers placed all across Eggtopia say that Chicken Week has ended.
</p>
<p>
The best cleansers are recognized for their hard work and courage at the end of Chicken Week. The government-issued Chicken Guns™ are able to detect how many chickens have been cleansed using it. This makes it easier for the officials at Capitol to tally the totals and determine top cleansers. In the decades that Chicken Week has occurred, nobody has been able to top the total of 6,000,000 chickens that was clocked in by Gregg McEgg himself during the inaugrual event in 1961.
