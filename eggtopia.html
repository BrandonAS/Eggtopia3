<h2>
Our Father
</h2>
<img src="gregg2.jpg" alt="Gregg McEgg" title=><br/>Gregg McEgg, circa 1957</>
<p>
On the 20th of June, 1957, Gregg McEgg was awakened by the sound of a loud thud. He exited his home to discover a very horrible automobile accident. Puzzled, he darted his eyes from one piece of the scene to the next. He then fixated his eyes on what he knew to be a miracle: a perfect egg, situated in the middle of the road, adjacent to the conflicting automobiles.
</p>
<p>
"It's the most beautiful sight imaginable!", chanted Gregg.
</p>
<p>
Gregg then made it his self-proclaimed prophecy to protect eggs at all costs. Gregg rallied his closest friends to join him in spreading the Word of Egg, and they spit in his face, calling him several names that alluded to a lack of intelligence. This wouldn't stop Gregg, however, as he knew that he was onto something beyond belief.
</p>
<p>
With no support from his ex-friends, Gregg was left to spread the Word of Egg by himself. He rented out a nearby hall, and advertised what would be a disguise to attract patrons. People would believe they were getting a lesson on trickle-down economics, when in actuality, they were on the cusp of enlightenment. Sure enough, Gregg's plan worked and roughly fifty people showed up at this <i>lesson on trickle-down economics</i>.
</p>
<p>
While the people felt robbed of this lesson they were promised, they took into consideration the value of the numerous egg facts being delivered to them by Gregg. By the end of this <s>indoctrination</s> enlightenment, Gregg had forty-two devout followers of the Word of Egg, as they now understood the value of protecting eggs at all costs. As his messengers were now available to spread the Word of Egg, Gregg built up enough funds to establish the first Church of Egg, located on the outskirts of Oregon.
</p>
<p>
Time went on and the number of messengers grew to the hundreds. The Word of Egg was finalized and formally published by Gregg McEgg in December of 1959. Since the sole Church of Egg had become too small to house all of the followers, those less fortunate were now able to purchase the Word of Egg at any book store. <i>This reflected the love of our Father.</i>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately for Gregg, he was constantly followed by <i>Men in Blue</i> for his "suspicious actions" behind the scenes at the Church of Egg. This didn't stop Gregg, however, as with enough followers and donations, he was able to create his own secluded island that was exclusive to followers of the Word. With this, Eggtopia was built and completed by February of 1961. All followers of the Word of Egg were transported to this island, with the given ability to live in harmony with one another.
</p>
<p>
As tensions grew between Gregg and the <i>Men in Blue</i>, he found it more and more difficult to survive. They harrassed him at all costs. Luckily, he was able to invest his money in elite scientific advancements. The scientists were able to create a machine that transferred one's consciousness into that of another being. Gregg decided to be both a guinea pig for science and an enhancement to the spirits of his followers. Gregg decided he would place his consciousness into an egg. Gregg's body was cryogenically frozen, and to this day, it is preserved in the Capitol of Eggtopia.
</p>
<p>
To this day, we honor our father through daily worship of the Sacred Egg.
</p>

<h2>
The Sacred Egg
</h2>
<img src="Egg.png" alt="Our One True Holy" title=><br/>Gregg McEgg, post-operation</>
<p>
While others view eggs as a prime source of protein, we must preserve them as they are a sacred symbol of our spiritual being. The only true crime would be to destroy an egg. <strong>To destroy egg is to destroy life.</strong> People are brainwashed into the consumption of eggs, and this couldn't be more of a sin.
</p>
<p>
Eggs are harvested from dinosaurs. The dinosaur is our affiliate, although we keep them on a separate island because they tend to be untamed and their instability could lead to deaths of our beloved Eggtopians. Eggs are imported to Eggtopia from Dinosauria, the land of dinosaurs. We preserve them here, at the Egg Temple. No eggs are sold at Eggmart. Eggs are not allowed within fifty feet of Eggmart.
</p>
<p>
Those who oppose the Word of Egg often question the ethicality of harvesting eggs from dinosaurs. Our response to that is that, while we love them, dinosaurs cannot be trusted with their own eggs, and we must therefore preserve them.
</p>
<p>
With the above in mind, those who oppose the Word of Egg also question the importance of eggs. To understand, it is important to remember the day that Gregg McEgg witnessed the accident. In the midst of an astounding amount of chaos, this perfect, untouched egg was the saving grace. This was the turning point in Gregg's life where he knew for sure what truly made life worth living. The purpose of life is to protect eggs at all costs.
</p>
<p>
To continuously remind ourselves of the importance of eggs, we do a daily prayer to our Sacred Egg. Those who fail will feel the wrath in the afterlife. We must worship eggs as the saving grace of the world. The egg is an almighty power harvesting both love and life itself. Our end goal must be to stop those who stand in the way of the egg's destined domination. Those guilty of this include the <i>Men in Blue</i> and more importantly, chickens.
</p>

<h2>
Our True Enemy
</h2>
<img src="chicken.png" alt="Our One True Enemy" title=><br/>The Only Thing to Hate</>
<p>
Nobody is trying to stop our cause more than chickens. Chickens are the true enemy of the Word of Egg, and we must do everything in our power to stop them. As it is known, eggs come solely from dinosaurs, and pesky chickens do everything in their power to snag every egg they see.
</p>
<p>
A gigantic staple of devoting your life to the Word of Egg involves helping to destroy chickens. This staple is accompanied by frequent training in anticipation of our annual Chicken Week. Chicken Week is a seven-day event devoted to the cleansing of the chicken population. Statistically, our Chicken Week cleansing totals enter the thousands. At last year's event, over 10,000 chickens were purged.
</p>
<p>
<i><small>Provided that they sign their lives over to Eggtopia</small></i>, people from all around the world visit us for Chicken Week. These people are primarily from the United States, as the <i>Men in Black</i> only allow us to air our commercials during the late hours of the night. The people who visit us for Chicken Week are often very interested in joining the Church of Egg. After all, they must be.
</p>

<h2>
Gregg's Plan
</h2>

<p>
Studying the official Word of Egg gives great insight into what Gregg's vision for the world truly was. Here at Eggtopia, Gregg's Plan lives on to the fullest. Gregg McEgg envisioned a clearer future by devoting life to the egg and eliminating the pesky chicken. The devotion to the egg gives the mind a sense of purpose and it fulfills a life in every way imaginable.
